# EnhancedMarvel
Enhanced Marvel is a chrome extension to add functionality to the Marvel Unlimited browser reader. ![](icons/icon48.png)


## Features
Currently it is very early in development, so it only supports two features. The first disables “Smart Panel” viewing by default (per personal preference) and the second enables a limited (and experimental) Two-Page view.

The two features can be enabled or disabled as desired through the options dialog for Enhanced Marvel in the Chrome extension menu at `chrome://extensions`. To reflect changes to these options, any currently open comics will have to be reloaded.

## Usage
You can download the latest released version of the extension on its  [page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-marvel/epehnppgfdjaboceagobphhdecaonomi) in the Chrome Web Store.

If you want the latest code, the extension can be loaded as follows:

1. Download this repository as a zip file and unpack it.
2. In the Chrome extension menu (navigate to `chrome://extensions`), enable “Developer Mode” if disabled.
3. In the same menu, select “Load Unpacked Extension...” and select the unpacked folder.
4. The extension should now be loaded and enabled.
